# Guillotine
This Guillotine game is for two players. The cards are placed in a line on the table and players take turns taking the first card from the line until all the cards are gone. Before a player takes a card, they can do a special action which rearranges the cards in the line. The goal is to end up with the most points at the end of the game.
